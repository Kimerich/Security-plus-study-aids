## ALE
### Annual Loss Expected
#### Amount a business can expect to lose on average per year. This is determined by the Annual Rate of Occurance (ARO) and the Single Loss Expectancy (SLE).
#### The formula to determine this is: ARO x SLE = ALE
- *Ex. We have a $20,000 car and there is a 2% chance it will be totalled. Our ALO is $400 for this year.*

## ARO
### Annual Rate of Occurance
#### How often an event is expected to happen in a year.
- *Over the past 5 years, 1 of our 10 cars was in a accident that totaled the vehicle . We have determined that we can expect to have 2% change of an accident per year.*

## BIA
### Business Impact Analysis
#### A systematic process to determine and evaluate the potential effects of an interruption to critical business operations as a result of a disaster, accident or emergency.
- * The owners of a restaurant look into what would happen if their business experienced a black out. Some of the effects include: lost business if they cannot continue operations, lost inventory if food spoils, increased risk of crime if alarms and cameras do not have battery backup, etc... They decide to mitigate this by purchasing a generator with some diesel to continue operations in case of such an event.*

## DRP
### Disaster Recovery Plan
#### A documented, structured approach that describes how an organization can quickly resume work after an unplanned incident.
- *Ex: Having a plan to rebuild in case a community is hit by a tornado, is on fire, or flood.*

## MTBF
### Mean Time Before Failure
#### The estimated time between failures of a system.
- *Ex: knowing your running shoes must be replaced every 6 months and replacing them accordingly.*

## MTTR
### Mean Time To Repair
#### The average time it takes to detect an issue, diagnose the problem, repair the fault and return the system to being fully functional..
- *Ex. An airplane has a common problem and the mechanics know exactly how long it will take to repair it.*

## RPO
### Recovery Point Objective
#### The goals that need to be met when conducting disaster recovery.
- *Ex. A restaurant's building is damaged. They decide they can reopen if the kitchen is fixed and go carryout/delivery only. They will fix the dining area eventually not it is not essential to the business operations of the restaurant..*

## RTO
### Recovery Time Objective
#### The length of time it should take an organization to a predetermined service level (or the RPO).
- *Ex. (from the RPO example)The restaurant is aiming to return to basic operations after 2 weeks. If it takes too long they will have to shut down due to lost revenue.*

## SLA
### Service Level Agreement
#### An agreement between a cloud service provider and a customer that ensures a minimum level of service is maintained.
- *Ex. A factory has an agreement with a supplier that they will always have a 3 day supply of parts available. Failure to meet this means that there will be no production or finished goods resulting in loss to the company.*

## SLE
### Single Loss Expectancy 
#### How much money weâ€™re going to lose if that single event occurs
- *Ex. My company has 2 cars both values at $20,000. If one is totalled in an accident it will be a loss of $20,000. (FOr now assume a car cannot be partially damaged.)*

## SLO
### Single Loss Occurance 
#### How often we can expect a single event to occur.
- *Ex. There is a 2% chance that one of our vehicles will be totalled in an accident.*
